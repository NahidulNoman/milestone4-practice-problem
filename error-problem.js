// Suppose, you have an array with 8 elements. Find the smallest element of that array.Now for the previous array, try to find the second largest element.






// this array 10 times reverse way using for loop

// let myStudy = ['unlock1', 'video2', 'practice3', 'support4'];
// for(let i = myStudy.length; i > 0; i--){
//     console.log(myStudy[i]);
// }

// this array 10 times reverse way using while loop
